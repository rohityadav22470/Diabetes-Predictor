## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various features such as:

* Pregnancies
* Insulin Level
* Age
* BMI
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the dataset's objective is to diagnostically predict diabetes in patients based on specific diagnostic measurements. Several constraints were applied when selecting instances from a larger database. Notably, all patients in this dataset are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. A simple  [random forest classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) was used for the prediction.
