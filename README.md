### Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various features such as:

* Pregnancies
* Insulin Level
* Age
* BMI
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the dataset's objective is to diagnostically predict diabetes in patients based on specific diagnostic measurements. Several constraints were applied when selecting instances from a larger database. Notably, all patients in this dataset are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. A simple  [random forest classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) was used for the prediction.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to gain hands-on experience with an end-to-end machine learning project and explore deployment platforms like [Heroku](https://g.co/kgs/yvsR77). Additionally, diabetes is an increasingly prevalent health issue due to our inactive lifestyle. Timely detection can help prevent adverse effects through proper medical treatment. Technology, particularly machine learning, can be used reliably and efficiently to aid in early detection. By building a predictive model, we aim to predict whether a patient has diabetes. Working on a project like this is not only educational but also potentially beneficial for society.

### Learning Objective
The following points were the objective of the project :
- Data gathering 
- Descriptive Analysis 
- Data Visualizations 
- Data Preprocessing 
- Data Modelling 
- Model Evaluation 
- Model Deployment 

### Technical Aspect 

- Training a machine learning model using scikit-learn. 
- Building and hosting a Flask web app on Heroku. 
- A user has to put details like Number of Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, BMI etc . 
- Once it get all the fields information , the prediction is displayed on a new page .
